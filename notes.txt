We have calculated all the possible height x width combinations of rectangles.

We need to figure out how to find 4 strings that wrap around a given rectangle.

Check the index of one string at the height value to see if it matches another string at
the width value.

For strings with a length of 12, need to check indices 3 to 10 for rectangles.
- There must be a "tail" of at least one letter that extends beyond the intersection of strings
at the beginning and end of each string,
so the first and last indices of a string will never need to be searched.
- The intersection of strings is "outside" of the rectangle.
The second and next to last will either be a tail or an intersection,
so they will never need to be searched.

Need two horizontal strings and two vertical strings.
1) Find the intersecting letters.
2) Maximize the rectangle size.

************ How to approach the problem **************
Set constraints.
Instead of trying to find intersections & then calculate the rectangle in the middle,
start with the largest rectangle, then see if you can wrap the strings around the rectangle.
If nothing fits, then you discard the rectangle and move to the next smallest rectangle.

Need a list of possible rectangle height/width combinations.
